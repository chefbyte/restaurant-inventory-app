🍽️ Restaurant Menu & Inventory Tracker (No-Code Project)

📁 This repo documents a no-code solution for restaurant operations, built in Airtable and extended with an optional Glide app for mobile ordering.

## 🔍 Overview

This project helps restaurants and cafes:
- Track ingredient inventory in real time
- Log additions, usage, and spoilage
- Dynamically manage active menu items based on ingredient availability
- Prototype a mobile app for digital menu browsing and simple order capture
- Lay the foundation for future cost analysis and supplier tracking

Built using Airtable with a focus on operations logic, not code.

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- **Airtable** – For managing inventory, menu items, and usage logs with no-code logic
- **Glide** – For building a mobile-friendly digital dessert menu and order form without writing code
- **CSV Import** – For loading sample ingredient and menu data
- **GitHub** – For documenting, versioning, and showcasing project work
- **Python (Pandas)** – Used to clean and export sample data to CSV for Glide import

## 🧩 Key Tables

- **Ingredients**: Units, costs, stock levels, and suppliers
- **Dishes (Recipes)**: Menu items with associated ingredients
- **Inventory Log**: Add/Subtract/Spoiled tracking
- **Suppliers** *(optional)*: Linked list of providers (can be added later)

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Link ingredients to supplier records
- Add cost-per-dish rollups
- Create menu availability logic tied to inventory
- Connect to a Glide App for mobile front-of-house interface
  
## 🍰 Digital Dessert Menu Prototype (Glide App)

This mobile-friendly dessert menu prototype was built using [Glide](https://www.glideapps.com/) as a proof of concept for a chef-driven ordering experience. It complements the Airtable inventory system by simulating front-of-house menu browsing and simple order submission.
