# restaurant-inventory-app
A no-code Airtable project to manage restaurant menu items, ingredients, and inventory logs.

## 🔍 Overview

This project helps restaurants and cafes:
- Track ingredient inventory in real time
- Log additions, usage, and spoilage
- Dynamically manage active menu items based on ingredient availability
- Lay the foundation for future cost analysis and supplier tracking

Built using Airtable with a focus on operations logic, not code.

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- **Airtable** – Database for managing inventory, dishes, and usage logs
- **CSV Import** – For initial ingredient data setup
- **GitHub** – For documenting and showcasing project work

## 🧩 Key Tables

- **Ingredients**: Units, costs, stock levels, and suppliers
- **Dishes (Recipes)**: Menu items with associated ingredients
- **Inventory Log**: Add/Subtract/Spoiled tracking
- **Suppliers** *(optional)*: Linked list of providers (can be added later)

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Link ingredients to supplier records
- Add cost-per-dish rollups
- Create menu availability logic tied to inventory
- Connect to a Glide App for mobile front-of-house interface

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to design real-world workflows using Airtable
- How to simulate inventory, cost, and menu logic with no code
- How to document and present a technical project on GitHub
